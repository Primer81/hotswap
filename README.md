# HotSwap
This is a small, simple mod for Minecraft (Forge) which adds hotkeys and mouse controls to cycle through rows of the player's inventory, either one slot at a time or the entire row.

## Controls
- `J` and `K`: cycle the current slot down and up, respectively (configurable)
- `H` and `L`: cycle the whole row down and up, respectively (configurable)
- `Alt+MWheel`: cycle the current slot
- `Ctrl+Alt+MWheel`: cycle the whole row
